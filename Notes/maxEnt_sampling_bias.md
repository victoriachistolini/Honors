# Sampling Bias in MaxEnt Models 



# Consequences of not correcting for sampling bias:

* Our sample of tick presence records is a sample of convience, the observations are recorded by observers 
* We want to correct for sampling bias because if we don't then the results of our predictions only reflect our techniques (sampling effort) rather than where the species is really located.


# Methods for correcting bias

* Use background points from regions with similar background bias as those of the data collected.
* Novel ways of mapping human motion, and human incounter liklihood.
* Get rid of correlation in model.
